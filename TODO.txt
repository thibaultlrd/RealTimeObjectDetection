Add live demo

Deploy backend + frontend somewhere accessible (for example: Google Cloud Run for backend, Streamlit Cloud or Vercel/Netlify for frontend).

Put the link in the README (“Demo: …”).

Maybe include a short video or GIF in the README showing it in action (webcam + detections).

Benchmarking

Measure FPS (frames per second) for different input sizes / hardware (e.g. laptop CPU, GPU, Raspberry Pi if possible).

Record inference latency & variance.

Configuration options & flexibility

Allow switching models via config (maybe allow YOLO vs SSD vs TFLite model).

Confidence threshold, input resolution as parameters.

Better error handling

If model file missing, invalid image format, backend unavailable, etc.

Friendly error messages.

Logging + Monitoring

Logs for requests / failures.

Possibly metrics endpoints (e.g. via Prometheus) for inference times / request counts.

Add more tests

Unit + integration.

Test frontend behavior (maybe mock calls to backend).

More polished UI features

Confidence slider.

Visual overlay of bounding boxes.

Toggle features.

If possible, livestream via webcam.

Code quality

Ensure consistent code style, linting.

Add more comments / docstrings / read some code coverage report.

Documentation

Add a “Design Decisions” section: why TFLite, why that model, why threshold values.

Limitations section.

Extend functionality

Could add object tracking (so bounding boxes keep persistent IDs over frames).

Could add ability to run on video file besides webcam.

Maybe support detecting model drift or allow adding “custom classes” via fine-tuning.
